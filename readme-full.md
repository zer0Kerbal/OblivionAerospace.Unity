# Oblivion Aerospace Pack

A small parts package of heat shields for Kerbal Space Program and the fabulous Deadly Reentry Continued mod maintained by Starwaster and NathanKell based on the works by ialdabaoth (who is awesome) and r4m0n.

(Forked to try and fix issues about a part dissapearance problem)

Features:
* Currently featuring the *Conical Heat Shield* inspired by the sphere-cone heat shield on the Mars Science Laboratory.
  * Comes in three sizes: 1.25m, 2.5m, and 3.75m.
  * Works great with Ferram Aerospace Research by ferram4 in that sphere-cone shaped heat shields offer greater control (by lift) over blunt ones.
  * Unlike the heat shields in DRE, the Conical Heat Shield does not have an "omni-decoupler". Instead, it has a single decoupler on the top attachment point (yellow/black ring), allowing for more custom designs.
  * Depending on size, it has additional attachment points inside the "bowl" of the shield for different sizes, allowing you to build more into the shield itself (say, science stuff which isn't needed once the shield is jetted).
  * Comes with an auto-shroud adapter that meets flush with the shield. It works like an engine shroud. Just add something to the heat shield's bottom node (like a decoupler) and the shroud/adapter will appear!

Known issues:
* Part dissapearences.

Future:
* More heat shields based on real-life ones, like a Galileo-style reflective heat shield.
* I've been playing with the idea of a giant heat shield with a "hatch" at the center, allowing for engines to fire through it once the hatch is open, allowing for a more realistic spaceship design with g-forces pointing the same direction during both burns and aerobreaking (like the one in BBC's documentary Space Odyssey: Voyage to the Planets).
* I have plans on making all heat shields tweakable in size, like the brilliant Procedural Fairings mod by e-dog.

Thanks to...
* ialdabaoth and r4m0n, for creating the excellent Deadly Reentry mod, and to NathanKell and Starwaster for extending upon and maintaining it. Heat shields would be boring without it!
* ferram4, for creating Ferram Aerospace Research, which really makes the KSP experience for me!
* Squad, for making such a great game!
* Hattivat, for testing.
